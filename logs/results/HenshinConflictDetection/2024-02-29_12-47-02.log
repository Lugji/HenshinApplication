Starting CDA with 6 rules.
[MultiCDA] Computing conflict atoms:
0 0 0 0 0 0    | createAccount
0 1 0 0 1 0    | deleteAccount
0 0 0 0 0 0    | assignManagerToAClient
1 1 0 1 0 0    | removeManagerFromClient
0 1 0 0 1 0    | moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother
0 0 1 0 1 1    | deleteInactiveClient

[MultiCDA] Computing binary granularity:
0 0 0 0 0 0    | createAccount
0 1 0 0 1 0    | deleteAccount
0 0 0 0 0 0    | assignManagerToAClient
1 1 0 1 0 0    | removeManagerFromClient
0 1 0 0 1 0    | moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother
0 0 1 0 1 1    | deleteInactiveClient

[MultiCDA] Computing minimal conflict reasons:
0 0 0 0 0 0    | createAccount
0 1 0 0 1 0    | deleteAccount
0 0 0 0 0 0    | assignManagerToAClient
1 1 0 1 0 0    | removeManagerFromClient
0 1 0 0 1 0    | moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother
0 0 1 0 1 1    | deleteInactiveClient

[MultiCDA] Computing initial conflict reasons:
0 0 0 0 0 0    | createAccount
0 1 0 0 1 0    | deleteAccount
0 0 0 0 0 0    | assignManagerToAClient
1 1 0 1 0 0    | removeManagerFromClient
0 1 0 0 1 0    | moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother
