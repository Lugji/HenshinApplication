[2024-03-31_22-21] User: Objective: Conduct a conflict analysis among a set of Cypher queries based on specific operational interactions. Your task is to identify conflicts that occur when one query's operations interfere with another's, following the criteria outlined in the given pseudocode.

Conflict Criteria:
- Conflicts arise if a DELETE clause in one query targets a node or edge that another query relies on in its MATCH clause.
- Conflicts are identified if one query deletes the same node or edge specified in the DELETE clause of another query.
- A conflict occurs if a CREATE clause in one query establishes an edge to a node that another query deletes.

Analysis Approach:
1. Systematically compare each pair of Cypher queries to uncover conflicts based on the criteria above.
2. For each query pair, examine if the DELETE actions in one query match elements referenced in the MATCH clauses of the other query.
3. Check for conflicts where one query deletes the same elements targeted by the DELETE clauses of another query.
4. Identify conflicts involving a CREATE action in one query that creates edges incident to nodes deleted by another query.

Expected Outcome:
Your analysis should result in a detailed report that articulates the conflicts between pairs of Cypher queries. Instead of a binary matrix, focus on describing:
- The specific nature of each conflict detected, following the pseudocode logic.
- Which queries are involved in each conflict scenario.
- How one query's DELETE, CREATE, or MATCH clause operations directly conflict with another's.

Please ensure your explanations are clear and directly correspond to the conflict detection criteria provided. This approach aims to capture the essence of operational conflicts within the below given Cypher queries: 
Cypher Query for rule createAccount:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:CLIENTS]->(client1:Client {name: 'client'}), (bank1)-[b:MANAGERS]->(manager1:Manager {name: 'manager'})-[c:CLIENTS]->(client1)
