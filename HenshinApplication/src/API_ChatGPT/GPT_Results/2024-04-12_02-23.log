[2024-04-12_02-23] User: **Objective**:
Perform an in-depth analysis of dependencies among a collection of Cypher queries within the environment of a graph database.

**Dependency Definitions**:
1. **Create-Dependency**: Identified when a query's `CREATE` action produces a node or relationship that becomes integral for the `MATCH` clause in subsequent queries.
2. **Delete-Forbid Dependency**: Detected when a query's `DELETE` action removes a graph element, negating the possibility for other queries to satisfy their negative application conditions (e.g., `WHERE NOT EXISTS`).

**Graph Elements Context**:
- **Nodes**: These are the core entities within the graph such as 'Bank', 'Account', 'Client', and 'Manager'.
- **Relationships**: These are the connectors depicting interactions or associations between nodes, exemplified by 'CLIENTS', 'MANAGES', 'OWNS', etc.

**Tasks**:
1. **Map Relationships**: Chart out the nodes and relationships involved in `CREATE`, `DELETE`, and negative conditions for each query.
2. **Dependency Impact Assessment**: Evaluate how each query could potentially influence the others, adhering strictly to the dependency definitions provided.
3. **Matrix Visualization**: Translate the dependency assessment into a binary matrix, assigning rows and columns to respective queries. A '1' denotes the presence of a dependency, while a '0' signifies its absence.

**Detailed Enhancements**:
- Append concise explanations for each query's intention to enrich the context for the dependency analysis.
- Account for secondary consequences, such as how a query might induce changes in the graph topology, potentially affecting other queries' effectiveness indirectly.
- Illustrate the analysis with tangible examples that demonstrate dependency emergence, particularly focusing on the specified nodes and relationships.

**Queries**:

Cypher Query for rule createAccount:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:CLIENTS]->(client1:Client), (bank1)-[b:MANAGERS]->(manager1:Manager)-[c:CLIENTS]->(client1)
WHERE NOT (bank1)-[:ACCOUNTS]->(:Account{id: 'accountId'})
CREATE (account1:Account), (bank1)-[d:ACCOUNTS]->(account1), (client1)-[e:ACCOUNTS]->(account1)

Cypher Query for rule deleteAccount:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:MANAGERS]->(manager1:Manager)-[c:CLIENTS]->(client1:Client), (bank1)-[b:CLIENTS]->(client1), (bank1)-[d:ACCOUNTS]->(account1:Account)-[e:OWNER]->(client1)
DELETE d, e, account1

Cypher Query for rule assignManagerToAClient:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:CLIENTS]->(client1:Client), (bank1)-[b:MANAGERS]->(manager1:Manager)
CREATE (manager1)-[c:CLIENTS]->(client1)

Cypher Query for rule moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:ACCOUNTS]->(account1:Account)-[d:OWNER]->(client1:Client), (bank1)-[b:CLIENTS]->(client2:Client), (bank1)-[c:CLIENTS]->(client1)
DELETE d
CREATE (account1)-[e:OWNER]->(client2)

Cypher Query for rule deleteManager:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:MANAGERS]->(manager1:Manager)-[b:CLIENTS]->(client1:Client), (bank1)-[c:CLIENTS]->(client1)
DELETE a, b, manager1

Cypher Query for rule createAClientWithAnAccAndManager:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:MANAGERS]->(manager1:Manager)
CREATE (client1:Client), (account1:Account), (bank1)-[b:CLIENTS]->(client1), (client1)-[c:ACCOUNTS]->(account1), (manager1)-[d:CLIENTS]->(client1), (bank1)-[e:ACCOUNTS]->(account1)


[2024-04-12_02-23] ChatGPT: **Task 1: Map Relationships**

1. **createAccount**: This query creates an account node and establishes relationships between the bank, client, and the newly created account. The `CREATE` action is dependent on the existence of a bank, a client, and a manager who manages the client but does not have an account.
2. **deleteAccount**: This query deletes an account and its associated relationships with the bank and the client. The `DELETE` action is dependent on the existence of a bank, a manager, a client, and an account that the client owns.
3. **assignManagerToAClient**: This query creates a relationship between a manager and a client. The `CREATE` action is dependent on the existence of a bank, a client, and a manager.
4. **moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother**: This query deletes the ownership of an account from one client and assigns it to another client. The `DELETE` and `CREATE` actions are dependent on the existence of a bank, two clients, and an account that one of the clients owns.
5. **deleteManager**: This query deletes a manager and its associated relationships with the bank and the client. The `DELETE` action is dependent on the existence of a bank, a manager, and a client that the manager manages.
6. **createAClientWithAnAccAndManager**: This query creates a client, an account, and establishes relationships between the bank, the newly created client, the newly created account, and a manager. The `CREATE` action is dependent on the existence of a bank and a manager.

**Task 2: Dependency Impact Assessment**

1. **createAccount** and **deleteAccount**: A `Create-Dependency` exists as the account created by `createAccount` can be deleted by `deleteAccount`.
2. **createAccount** and **moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother**: A `Create-Dependency` exists as the account created by `createAccount` can be moved by `moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother`.
3. **createAccount** and **createAClientWithAnAccAndManager**: A `Delete-Forbid Dependency` exists as the account created by `createAccount` can prevent `createAClientWithAnAccAndManager` from creating a new account with the same ID.
4. **assignManagerToAClient** and **deleteManager**: A `Create-Dependency` exists as the manager-client relationship created by `assignManagerToAClient` can be deleted by `deleteManager`.
5. **createAClientWithAnAccAndManager** and **deleteAccount**: A `Create-Dependency` exists as the account created by `createAClientWithAnAccAndManager` can be deleted by `deleteAccount`.
6. **createAClientWithAnAccAndManager** and **deleteManager**: A `Create-Dependency` exists as the manager-client relationship created by `createAClientWithAnAccAndManager` can be deleted by `deleteManager`.

**Task 3: Matrix Visualization**

| Queries | createAccount | deleteAccount | assignManagerToAClient | moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother | deleteManager | createAClientWithAnAccAndManager |
|---------|---------------|---------------|------------------------|-----------------------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| createAccount | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| deleteAccount | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| assignManagerToAClient | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |
| moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| deleteManager | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| createAClientWithAnAccAndManager | 0 | 1 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 |

A '1' denotes the presence of a dependency, while a '0' signifies its absence.
