[2024-04-12_02-21] User: **Objective**:
Perform an in-depth analysis of dependencies among a collection of Cypher queries within the environment of a graph database.

**Dependency Definitions**:
1. **Create-Dependency**: Identified when a query's `CREATE` action produces a node or relationship that becomes integral for the `MATCH` clause in subsequent queries.
2. **Delete-Forbid Dependency**: Detected when a query's `DELETE` action removes a graph element, negating the possibility for other queries to satisfy their negative application conditions (e.g., `WHERE NOT EXISTS`).

**Graph Elements Context**:
- **Nodes**: These are the core entities within the graph such as 'Bank', 'Account', 'Client', and 'Manager'.
- **Relationships**: These are the connectors depicting interactions or associations between nodes, exemplified by 'CLIENTS', 'MANAGES', 'OWNS', etc.

**Tasks**:
1. **Map Relationships**: Chart out the nodes and relationships involved in `CREATE`, `DELETE`, and negative conditions for each query.
2. **Dependency Impact Assessment**: Evaluate how each query could potentially influence the others, adhering strictly to the dependency definitions provided.
3. **Matrix Visualization**: Translate the dependency assessment into a binary matrix, assigning rows and columns to respective queries. A '1' denotes the presence of a dependency, while a '0' signifies its absence.

**Detailed Enhancements**:
- Append concise explanations for each query's intention to enrich the context for the dependency analysis.
- Account for secondary consequences, such as how a query might induce changes in the graph topology, potentially affecting other queries' effectiveness indirectly.
- Illustrate the analysis with tangible examples that demonstrate dependency emergence, particularly focusing on the specified nodes and relationships.

**Queries**:

Cypher Query for rule createAccount:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:CLIENTS]->(client1:Client), (bank1)-[b:MANAGERS]->(manager1:Manager)-[c:CLIENTS]->(client1)
WHERE NOT (bank1)-[:ACCOUNTS]->(:Account{id: 'accountId'})
CREATE (account1:Account), (bank1)-[d:ACCOUNTS]->(account1), (client1)-[e:ACCOUNTS]->(account1)

Cypher Query for rule deleteAccount:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:MANAGERS]->(manager1:Manager)-[c:CLIENTS]->(client1:Client), (bank1)-[b:CLIENTS]->(client1), (bank1)-[d:ACCOUNTS]->(account1:Account)-[e:OWNER]->(client1)
DELETE d, e, account1

Cypher Query for rule assignManagerToAClient:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:CLIENTS]->(client1:Client), (bank1)-[b:MANAGERS]->(manager1:Manager)
CREATE (manager1)-[c:CLIENTS]->(client1)

Cypher Query for rule moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:ACCOUNTS]->(account1:Account)-[d:OWNER]->(client1:Client), (bank1)-[b:CLIENTS]->(client2:Client), (bank1)-[c:CLIENTS]->(client1)
DELETE d
CREATE (account1)-[e:OWNER]->(client2)

Cypher Query for rule deleteManager:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:MANAGERS]->(manager1:Manager)-[b:CLIENTS]->(client1:Client), (bank1)-[c:CLIENTS]->(client1)
DELETE a, b, manager1

Cypher Query for rule createAClientWithAnAccAndManager:
MATCH (bank1:Bank)-[a:MANAGERS]->(manager1:Manager)
CREATE (client1:Client), (account1:Account), (bank1)-[b:CLIENTS]->(client1), (client1)-[c:ACCOUNTS]->(account1), (manager1)-[d:CLIENTS]->(client1), (bank1)-[e:ACCOUNTS]->(account1)


[2024-04-12_02-21] ChatGPT: Based on the provided Cypher queries and the defined dependency types, let's analyze the dependencies among them:

### 1. Map Relationships:
- **createAccount**:
  - **Nodes**: Bank, Client, Manager, Account
  - **Relationships**: CLIENTS, MANAGERS, ACCOUNTS
- **deleteAccount**:
  - **Nodes**: Bank, Manager, Client, Account
  - **Relationships**: MANAGERS, CLIENTS, ACCOUNTS, OWNER
- **assignManagerToAClient**:
  - **Nodes**: Bank, Client, Manager
  - **Relationships**: CLIENTS
- **moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother**:
  - **Nodes**: Bank, Account, Client
  - **Relationships**: ACCOUNTS, OWNER, CLIENTS
- **deleteManager**:
  - **Nodes**: Bank, Manager, Client
  - **Relationships**: MANAGERS, CLIENTS
- **createAClientWithAnAccAndManager**:
  - **Nodes**: Bank, Client, Manager, Account
  - **Relationships**: MANAGERS, CLIENTS, ACCOUNTS

### 2. Dependency Impact Assessment:
- **createAccount**:
  - **Create-Dependency**: None
  - **Delete-Forbid Dependency**: Potential impact on `deleteAccount` if the created account is deleted.
- **deleteAccount**:
  - **Create-Dependency**: None
  - **Delete-Forbid Dependency**: Impacts `createAccount` as it deletes the account created.
- **assignManagerToAClient**:
  - **Create-Dependency**: None
  - **Delete-Forbid Dependency**: None
- **moveAccountFromOneClientToAnother**:
  - **Create-Dependency**: None
  - **Delete-Forbid Dependency**: None
- **deleteManager**:
  - **Create-Dependency**: None
  - **Delete-Forbid Dependency**: Impacts `createAClientWithAnAccAndManager` as it deletes the manager.
- **createAClientWithAnAccAndManager**:
  - **Create-Dependency**: Potential impact on `deleteManager` if the created manager is deleted.
  - **Delete-Forbid Dependency**: None

### 3. Matrix Visualization:
